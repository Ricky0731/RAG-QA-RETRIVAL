**RAG-QA-Retrieval**

This is a project that implements a Document Question Answering (QA) system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques alongside OpenAI's GPT-4 model. This system retrieves relevant information from a document corpus to generate accurate answers to user queries.

### Features

The project includes several key features: it integrates retrieval techniques with GPT-4â€™s generative capabilities for improved question answering; it efficiently processes and indexes documents for quick retrieval; it provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to ask questions and receive answers; and it is customizable, making it easily adjustable for different datasets and document formats.

### Google Colab Setup

To run this project in Google Colab, follow these steps: 

First, open the Colab Notebook by clicking on the provided link to access the Colab notebook. At the beginning of the notebook, make sure to run the code cell that installs the necessary libraries. 

Next, upload your documents directly to the Colab environment using the provided code snippet that allows for file uploads. 

Also, ensure that you set up any necessary API keys, such as for OpenAI, in the notebook environment. You can input them directly in the notebook or store them securely.

### Usage

To use the project, execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to build the retrieval system and initialize the model. Once the setup is complete, you can input your queries in the designated cell, and the system will return answers based on the retrieved documents. Example queries include questions like "What is the main topic of the document?" or "Can you summarize the key points discussed in section X?"

### Project Structure

The project structure within the Colab environment includes the main Colab notebook, titled Document_QA_with_GPT_4o_RAG.ipynb, and a folder for documents, which are uploaded during runtime.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or want to add features, please open an issue or submit a pull request. To contribute, fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, commit them, push to the branch, and then open a pull request.


### Acknowledgments

Special thanks to OpenAI for providing the GPT-4 API and to all contributors and libraries used in this project. For any inquiries or further assistance, please feel free to reach out!
