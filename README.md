Great! If you've implemented your project using Google Colab, we can adjust the README to reflect that, including details on how to run the Colab notebook. Below is a revised version of the README specifically tailored for a project that is executed within Google Colab.

# RAG-QA-Retrieval

## Overview

**RAG-QA-Retrieval** is a project that implements a Document Question Answering (QA) system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques alongside OpenAI's GPT-4 model. This system retrieves relevant information from a document corpus to generate accurate answers to user queries.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Integrates retrieval techniques with GPT-4’s generative capabilities for improved question answering.
- **Document Processing**: Efficiently processes and indexes documents for quick retrieval.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an interactive environment for users to ask questions and receive answers.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjustable for different datasets and document formats.

## Google Colab Setup

To run this project in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**:
   - Click [here](https://github.com/Ricky0731/RAG-QA-RETRIVAL/blob/main/Document_QA_with_GPT_4o_RAG.ipynb) to open the Colab notebook.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Make sure to run the following code cell at the beginning of the notebook to install the necessary libraries:

3. **Upload Your Documents**:
   - You can upload your documents directly to the Colab environment. Use the following code snippet to upload files:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()
   ```

4. **Set Up API Keys**:
   - Ensure you set up any necessary API keys (such as for OpenAI) in the notebook environment. You can input them directly in the notebook or store them securely.

## Usage

1. **Run the Cells**:
   - Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to build the retrieval system and initialize the model.
  
2. **Ask Questions**:
   - Once the setup is complete, you can input your queries in the designated cell, and the system will return answers based on the retrieved documents.

3. **Example Queries**:
   - "What is the main topic of the document?"
   - "Can you summarize the key points discussed in section X?"
